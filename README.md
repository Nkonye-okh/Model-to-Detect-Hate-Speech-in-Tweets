# Model-to-Detect-Hate-Speech-in-Tweets
Finding hate speech on Twitter and other social media threads has become paramount.
This dataset used to build the model was gotten from Twitter API, containing tweets of users. Some of these tweets contain hate speech while some do not.
The objective of this model is to detect hate speech in tweets. A tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist, sexist, or slurs sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify those tweets from other tweets.


The dataset has been labelled according, where label '1' denotes the tweet is hate speech and label '0' denotes the tweet is not.
